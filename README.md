# belly-button-challenge
This challenge has us create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard catalogues the microbes that colonize human navels using a dataset about belly button diversity.

The dashboard contains four specific aspects.

The first is a dropdown menu that lets you choose which otu_id you would like to see the data of.
The second is a bar chart that displays the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
the third is a bubble chart that showcases each sample
and finally the fourth is the information on the chosen demographic.
